games we're playing Starfield on Xbox
series X but I'm going to give you some
PC tips as well so if you're trying to
decorate your house
you can actually pick up items by
holding down a on Xbox or E on PC you
can pick up and move bodies all sorts of
things if you can carry it or interact
with it you can usually pick it up now
the trick is rotation so on Xbox right
trigger and left trigger will rotate
right rotate left on PC left and right
click will change the rotation now the
real skill is making sure you're
rotating the right access you want so
you can rotate on the Zed the X and the
y axis to make sure that the item is
exactly where you want it to be and to
change which one you're rotating you
push in the left stick on Xbox or press
shift on PC now the game doesn't tell
you what you're rotating so you're just
gonna have to give it a little rotation
to see what's moving
then
once you've got it placed if you don't
like where it is you can throw it
on Xbox holding down X will let you
throw it pretty far on PC it's the r key
but you can do a little throw so just
tapping X do a little throw but if you
really want to love it across the map
just hold down the button get a nice
angle and then let it go and that's it
that's all the skills in placing items
now you can decorate your house get good
at it and place things exactly where you
want",,,2023-09-16 12:55:30.815186
