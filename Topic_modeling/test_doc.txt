Vanity is an interesting word. If you look up vanity in the dictionary, you'll discover that it can mean both excessive pride and something that is empty, futile, or without value. It's intriguing to think that we can be proud of something that matters very little. But this does happen sometimes, especially when it comes to business metrics. In fact, those of us in business intelligence have a term for this phenomenon: vanity metrics. Vanity metrics are data points that are intended to impress others but are not indicative of actual performance and therefore cannot reveal any meaningful business insights. A well-known vanity metric is the number of people following a company on social media. Maybe there are hundreds of thousands of followers but how many of them are actually making a purchase, how many of them refer other customers to the site, and how much revenue do they actually generate for the business? Showing off a number just because it's big, rarely accomplishes much. And that's why it's critical to ensure each metric you monitor is productive, informative, and effective. For example, some useful business metrics might include a restaurant's customer loyalty rate, a manufacturing team's productivity levels, a fitness center's monthly profits and losses, or the amount of inventory in a pharmacy's warehouse. These are numbers that can lead to useful business insights. When determining which metrics to include on a dashboard, BI professionals consider four key things. First, more information is not necessarily better. Your stakeholders will appreciate it if you limit the number of metrics on your dashboards by including only those that are critical to project success. Do this by thinking about user requirements, what users already know, and what they need to learn to help them meet those requirements. Too many metrics, especially irrelevant or unnecessary metrics, can confuse people and devalue your dashboard. Next, makes sure metrics are aligned with business objectives. Consider your organization's specific goals, then pinpoint which metrics can be used to support them and measure success. Confirm that the necessary technologies and processes are in place to obtain and analyze the data you need for each metric. This is another time to think about all the factors related to data availability. Avoid vague or super high level metrics. Instead, they should be clear and precise enough to inform a particular action. The SMART methodology can help you identify the key metrics for the particular issue at hand. As you may know, this tool helps determine a question's effectiveness. However, it can also help you refine metrics based on whether they are specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. If you earned the Google Data Analytics Certificate, you learned about the SMART methodology. Feel free to review that lesson before moving ahead. As a final point, it's wise to identify the most important metric first and prominently display it at the top of your dashboard. Then supporting metrics can drill down into the details below. For instance, when making a dashboard for a tomato farm, you might put the number of tomato pallets shipped at the top because total sales is a key metric. Then the data that supports pallet shipments, such as worker productivity and the efficiency of the harvesting machines would be displayed underneath. In addition, your users will appreciate it if you group related metrics together. For our tomato farmer, that would mean placing sales data in one section, production insights in another, harvest rates in another, and so on. Keep in mind that the best metrics highlight two key things, how the organization is doing, and what decision-makers should focus on. In other words, they ensure your dashboards are never created in vain.
